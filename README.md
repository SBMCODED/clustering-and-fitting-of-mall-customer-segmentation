analyzing the Mall Customer Segmentation dataset to gain insights into customer behavior and preferences. Initially, the dataset was loaded and preprocessed to extract relevant features like annual income and spending score. Exploratory data analysis included visualizations such as scatter plots, bar charts, and histograms to understand the distribution and relationships between variables. Statistical analyses like correlation coefficients and descriptive statistics provided additional insights.

The project then delved into predictive modeling using polynomial and exponential fitting techniques. Polynomial regression was employed to capture non-linear relationships between annual income and spending score, while exponential fitting aimed to model exponential growth or decay patterns in the data. The performance of these models was evaluated based on fitting quality and prediction accuracy metrics.

Clustering analysis was also conducted to segment customers based on their annual income and spending score, utilizing the K-means algorithm. Evaluation of clustering quality involved methods such as the silhouette score and visualization of clustered data points. This allowed for identification of distinct customer segments and tailored marketing strategies.
